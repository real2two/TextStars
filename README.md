This bot was created for the SnowCodes event. https://www.snowcodes.org/

The code itself was written in 3 days on a school computer. This repository should *not* be used to assess my coding proficiency.

This is *supposed* to be Christmas themed so here are some prompts you can use: `throw snowball`, `sugar rush`, `gingerbread`, `snowman`, `tree`, `christmas`, `gift`, `santa`, `sugar cane`, etc...
